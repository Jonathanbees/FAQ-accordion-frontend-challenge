# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion

![Design preview for the FAQ accordion coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Issues building this project
The most difficult part of creating this project is to align each image with each text, like the titles, another difficult thing that happened (i spend some hours of that) is to build the accordion with each change of the image, in this code, i let the attempts with a little function that i tried, but then i discard it

I enjoy (and also suffer) this but at least i learn a lot :)
